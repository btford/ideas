# Ideas

Feel free to implement any of these for the good of mankind.

*  CSS optimizer that takes a CSS file and a set of HTML pages and returns the CSS with only selectors used by the set of pages.
*  <del>Minifier/uglifier/preprocessor for [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) that annotates unannotated code (see "[A Note on Minification](http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_05)") and renames controllers, services, modules, and directives, rewriting the HTML accordingly. Probably could use [Esprima](http://esprima.org/) and [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) for some stuff.</del> See [ngmin](https://github.com/btford/ngmin)
* [docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/)-style blog, for code side-by-side with annotations.

And if any of these already exist, please let me know. Thanks.
